**Graceful Degradation & Service Workers:**  
As defined in the lab assignment write-up, "graceful degradation is when we start with max technology and hopefully address lower levels with grace". Thus, taking this lab as an example, we start with a web-app that properly fetches recipes and makes recipe cards. Afterwards, we turn to service workers to address the problem of our web-app being completely reliant on network connection. Hence, I believe that service workers reflect the practice of graceful degradation since it relates to addressing the lower level issues of reliability on network connection.
